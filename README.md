Used java 8 to implement code which has the ability to produce a comma delimited list of numbers, grouping the numbers into a range when they are sequential.

Code is under src/numberrangessummarizer:

-Main.Java //Used as main to run project

-SequentialGrouping.java //Used as class that implemnts given interface NumberRangeSummarizer to do transformations

-NumberRangeSummarizer.java //Given Interface

-summarizeCollectionTest.java //Unit Test For summarizeCollection Method in SequentialGrouping Class

-collectTest.java //Unit Test For collect method in SequentialGrouping Class
